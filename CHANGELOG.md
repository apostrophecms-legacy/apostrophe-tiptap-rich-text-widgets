# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Spreadsheet import button supporting Excel and CSV files. The imported spreadsheet becomes a table in your rich text widget, replacing all previous content in the widget. Thanks to Michelin for making this possible via [ApostropheCMS Enterprise Support](https://apostrophecms.com/support/enterprise-support).

## 0.2.0

You can now use this module in a subclass of `apostrophe-rich-text-widgets` by setting `tiptap: true` for that module, and `tiptap: false` for the standard `apostrophe-rich-text-widgets` module. This permits a mix of the two editors on a site, for instance for those who like the table editing of this module but are not ready to commit fully.

## 0.1.1

Clicking the Table button no longer unfocuses the editor.

## 0.1.0

Initial technology preview release. Good editor functionality, see stability notes.
